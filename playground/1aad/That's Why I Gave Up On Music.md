- starting off the year with a look back
- this was the album that got me to start 1aad last year and changed how i interacted with music, i wanted to give it and this series a good re-listen
- this time I wasn't looking at the translated lyrics or anything, just listening to the music
- even with the 100+ albums i've listened to since then, i still think the pacing of yorushika's albums is stellar with a great mix of the more energetic rock and the quieter melodic piano they're great at
- I also appreciated the vocals beyond the lyrics more this time around, it really serves as an excellent primary instrument, and the singer is very talented at focusing the tone of each song
