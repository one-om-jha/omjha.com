- my thoughts haven't changed a crazy amount
- musically, pretty similar to the last one, just a little more mature
- I think the best tracks on this one really stand out in comparison, and those songs themselves are a little better paced I think
- The small little interspersed piano pieces are again excellent, my favorites being 4/10 and 8/31
